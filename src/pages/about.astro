      I've started this website to share few things I've learnt and still
      learning about computer science, mathematics things realted to STEM and
      ADHD. Yes I do have ADHD, this is my secret super power. I am a happy
      husband thanks to my wonderful wife and a busy father with my lovely
      daugthers :sweat_smile: . I am not looking for job for now, as I've just
      changed couples month ago, but if you work with cloud and have complex
      problem related to scalability and distributed computing, you have a link
      to my twitter or linkedin profile.
